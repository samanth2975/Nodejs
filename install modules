Install Modules with npm install
npm install <module>
npm install express

When you're running npm install to install a module, you can add the optional flag --save to the command. This flag will add the module as a dependency
of your project to the project's package.json as an entry in dependencies.
npm install <module> --save (save changes in package.json)

In addition to triggering an install of a single module, you can actually trigger the installation of all modules that are listed as dependencies and
devDependencies in the package.json in the current directory. To do so, you'll simply need to run the command itself:

npm install

Install Modules and Save Them to Your package.json as a Developer dependency
There's a flag that is nearly an exact duplicate, in terms of functionality, of the --save flag when installing a module: --save-dev. 
There are a few a key differences between the two - instead of saving the module being installed and added to package.json as an entry in dependencies,
it will save it as an entry in the devDependencies.

npm install <module> --save-dev

UNINSTALL

npm uninstall <module> --save
npm uninstall <module> --save-dev


INSTALL UNINSTALL globally

npm install <module> -g
npm uninstall <module> -g
npm remove <module> -g
npm rm <module> -g
